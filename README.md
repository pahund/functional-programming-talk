# Functional Programming in JavaScript

## eBay Tech Talk by [Patrick Hund](http://www.twitter.com/wiekatz)

Code examples from my talk about functional programming in JavaScript.

View the corresponding slides on [MindMeister](http://www.mindmeister.com/489584519/ebay-tech-talk-by-patrick-hund-18-dec-2014).

**Full credit for these code examples 001 to 006 goes to [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/).**

## Branches

If you want to take a shot at solving Crockford's coding exercises yourself, after cloning the repository, check out
branch `unsolved`.

To see the progressive refactoring of the [scroll-throttle](examples/100_scroll-throttle/example.js) example I demonstrated
during my talk, checkout out branches `step1`, `step2` and `step3` (`master` is the final version).
